/*A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000.
He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.
He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old car and of the new one
decrease of 1.5 percent per month. Furthermore the percent of loss
increases by a fixed 0.5 percent at the end of every two months.
How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and how much money will he have left over?

		nbMonths(2000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [6, 766]
		where 6 is the number of months at the end of which he can buy the new car and 766 is the nearest integer to '766.158...' .*/
